# Data-Governance-week-1
Data Governance - its a framework that is used to proactivily manage your data and managing the quality of your data to help the orgainiation focusing on increasing the value of data and reduces the risk behind.
Advantages of good data governance:
- improved data
- extented data value
- increased data compliance
- improved data driven decision making
- improved data search
- reduced data related risk

1. A policy to mandate how your organisation is going to manage its data
2. Roles and responsibilities concerning data
3. processes detailing how we going to manage data.
Governance is the system that formalizes control, processes, and accountabilities so that specific results such as meeting goals or sustaining standards can be attained.
Data Governance:
Discovery -identifying all the different types of data assets you have in your repostries in the cloud.
Classification- assigning data to direrent categories
Rules- help inforce data policies.
Policy- standards of managing data.
MetaData- helps describes what the data is, its origin and what it is.

Today, when data is managed well, it can drive innovation and growth and can be an enterprise’s most abundant and important lever for success.
Every organization manages data at some level. All businesses generate, process, use, and store data as a result of their daily operations. But there’s a huge difference between businesses that casually manage data and those that consider data to be a valuable asset and treat it accordingly. This difference is characterized by the degree to which there are formalities in managing data.
 the discipline in which an organization acts in recognition of the value of its information assets (a fancy term for data with specific value to an organization, such as a customer or product record) is called enterprise information management (EIM). Governing and managing data well is a central enabler of EIM, which also includes using technologies and processes to elevate data to be a shared enterprise asset.
 Data governance is focused on roles and responsibilities, policies, definitions, metrics, and the lifecycle of data. Data management is the technical implementation of data governance. 
 Data management is the technical implementation of data governance. For example, databases, data warehouses and lakes, application programming interfaces (APIs), analytics software, encryption, data crunching, and architectural design and implementation are all data management features and functions.
 Information governance - is entirely concerned with the meaning of the data and its relationship in terms of outcomes and value to the organization, customers, and other stakeholders.
  Creating a data governance Program
  - Defining the vision, goals, and benefits.
   - Analyzing the current state of data governance and management.
    - Developing a proposal based on the first two steps, including a draft plan.
     - Achieving leadership approval.
      - Designing and developing the program.
       - Implementing the program.
         - Monitoring and measuring performance.
           - Maintaining the program.
          you cannot buy a data governance program off the shelf. That’s actually good news. Organizations must implement a program relative to its level of interest, as well as its needs, budget, and capabilities
Data governance framework:
Leadership and Strategy ;
Your data governance program must be aligned with the strategy of the organization.
The disconnect between business goals and data governance is the number one reason that data governance programs fail. When mapping organizational strategy to data governance, you need the support, agreement, and sponsorship of senior leadership. I’ll be blunt about this: Without full support from your organization’s leaders, your data governance efforts won’t succeed.
Roles and Responsibilities -
Your data governance program will only be possible with the right people doing the right things at the right time.
Policies , processes and standards
At the heart of every data governance program are the policies, processes, and standards that guide responsibilities and support uniformity across the organization. Each of these must be designed, developed, and deployed.
Metrics: 
The data governance program must have a mechanism to measure whether it is delivering the expected results. Capturing metrics and delivering them to a variety of stakeholders is important for maintaining support, which includes funding.
Tools:
Fortunately, a large marketplace now exists for tools in support of data governance and management. These include tools for master data management, data catalogs, search, security, integration, analytics, and compliance. In recent years, many data science-related tools have made leaps in terms of incorporating ease-of-use and automation.
Communications and collaboration :
With the introduction of data governance and the ongoing, sometimes evolving, requirements, high-quality communications are key. This takes many forms, including in-person meetings, emails, newsletters, and workshops.
A large number of disparate stakeholders need to work together in order to effectively govern data. Collaboration is essential and can be the difference between success and failure.
Preparing Data Governance:
What is data culture :
Many well-designed projects and initiatives fall flat and fail even though their teams seem to have done everything right. Too often, the work gets deployed into an environment that is either not ready for change or doesn’t have the optimum conditions for success.
Assessing the data culture:
If you want to increase your chances of success - you need to understand the data culture of your organization and determine how to broaden and mature it if necessary. You need an environment for success.
On a basic level, data culture is how your organization values data and how it manages and uses it. There’s a wide chasm between companies that simply manage data as a consequence of doing business versus those that consider data central to how their organization operates and makes decisions (the latter being the qualities exhibited by a mature data culture).
In a data culture, decisions don’t rely on gut feelings, guesses, or the opinion of the highest-paid/ranking person in the room. Rather, decisions are based on data and the insights they can produce.
Assessing Data Governance Readiness
So, you’ve either determined your organization has a good data culture, or you’ve put into action some steps to help move it forward, and now you’ve decided it’s time to roll up your sleeves and begin designing a data governance program. Right?

Determine the Data governance readiness of your organisation by this chechlist.
-The basis of a data culture exists.
The program is 100 percent aligned with business strategy.
Senior leadership is 100 percent committed to the program and its goals.
Senior leadership understands this is a strategic, enterprise program and not the sole responsibility of the IT department.
One or more sponsors have been identified at an executive level.
The program has the commitment to fund its creation and to maintain it in the long term.
The organization understands this is an ongoing program and not a one-off project.
You have documented the return-on-investment (ROI).
Legal and compliance teams (internally or externally) understand and support the goals of the program.
Fundamental data skills exist for the data governance journey.
The IT organization is capable and resourced to support the program.
Data refers to collections of digitally stored units, in other words, stuff that is kept on a computing device. 

Structured: Data that has been formatted to a set structure; each data unit fits nicely into a table in a database. It’s ready for analysis. Examples include first name, last name, and phone number.
Unstructured: Data that are stored in a native format must be processed to be used. Further work is required to enable analysis. Examples include email content and social media posts.
Semi-structured: Data that contains additional information to enable the native format to be searched and analyzed.
Zettabyte
 A zettabyte is a big number. A really big number. It’s 1021, or a 1 with 21 zeros after it
