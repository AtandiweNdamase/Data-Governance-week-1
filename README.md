Today, when data is managed well, it can drive innovation and growth and can be an enterprise’s most abundant and important lever for success.
Every organization manages data at some level. All businesses generate, process, use, and store data as a result of their daily operations. But there’s a huge difference between businesses that casually manage data and those that consider data to be a valuable asset and treat it accordingly. This difference is characterized by the degree to which there are formalities in managing data.
 the discipline in which an organization acts in recognition of the value of its information assets (a fancy term for data with specific value to an organization, such as a customer or product record) is called enterprise information management (EIM). Governing and managing data well is a central enabler of EIM, which also includes using technologies and processes to elevate data to be a shared enterprise asset.
 Data governance is focused on roles and responsibilities, policies, definitions, metrics, and the lifecycle of data. Data management is the technical implementation of data governance.
